#   "CSRF verification failed... Origin checking failed - https://<domain>
#    does not match any trusted origins."
# This hits django.contrib.admin and the DRF browsable API (both use
# session+CSRF auth); the JWT-authenticated mobile API endpoints aren't
# affected by CSRF at all (DRF only enforces it for SessionAuthentication).

# Tells Django to trust the X-Forwarded-Proto header Railway's proxy sets,
